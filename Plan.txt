Rules of the game:
------------------

Players are dealt two cards face up.
The deal is dealt two cards, one face up on face down.

Players can either:
	Hit  	- dealt the next card from the deck face up.
	Stick 	- stop accepting new cards 

Aces can be either 1 or 11, they are automatically assign 1 to prevent a hand exceeding 21 (bust)
A hand containing an ace is classified as "soft"

A players turn ends when either the following are true:
	Bust 	- Exceeded 21
	Stick 	- stop accepting new cards

It is then dealers turn. The dealer:
	Shows their face down card
	if their hand is 17 and not "soft", they automatically stick
	if their hand is "soft" 17 (contains an ace and one or more cards totalling 6):
		they must also hit
	if their hand is less then 17, they hit until >17 or 21 is reached
	if their hand is 21, they stick

A dealer busts if there hand is over 21.

Players win by:
 	not busting and having a total higher than the dealer
 	not busting and having the dealer bust
	getting a blackjack without the dealer getting a blackjack

			this is called a "push"
			the money is returned to the player
