# Blakjac

This is a simple implementation of the famous casino game Black Jack.
The game is command line based, with awesome ASCII graphics :)

Would be great to get some feedback on my newly found coding skills (already know I misspelled shuffle).

To start the game, take a copy of the project and run the game.py file, enjoy!
